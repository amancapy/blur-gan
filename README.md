**fixing blurry images with a GAN**

results are decent-ish surprisingly.

02/10: gan training done, it seems the average of the geometric and arithmetic averages of three picked generations of the model is a good result. some outputs are still somehow blurry but I'm calling it a day. plan is to now apply this to larger images by splicing them into small squares then stitching them back together again post-gan.
